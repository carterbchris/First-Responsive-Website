## Acknowledgments

I would like to take all credit for this project. From just looking at the example picture given I tried to make this website as responsive as I possbily could to fit most screens. My measurement units might be off and some CSS lines may not do ANYTHING but in the end it got me to my disired goal. 

I am currently still in the foundation portion of The Odin Project - studying bits of html and css here and there over the course of this month. VERY new. I would say this website took me 8 hours of fiddling around and looking forward to the next challenge.


THANKS for reading and appreciate any feedback.
